Trilium provides some advanced functionality in the form of [[Scripts]] and [[promoted attributes]]. To explain and visualize these features we've prepared few showcases which are also available in the [[demo document|Document#demo-document]]:

* [[Relation map]]
* [[Day notes]]
* [[Weight Tracker]]
* [[Task Manager]]

Important thing to keep in mind is that above showcases and demoed functionality are not built-in into Trilium - these are just examples of Trilium's extensibility.
