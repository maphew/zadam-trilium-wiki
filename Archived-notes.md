Archived notes are notes which have `archived` [[label|attributes]] - either directly or [[inherited|Attribute inheritance]].

Such notes are then by default not shown in the autocomplete and in the full text [[search]].

This can be useful for notes which are no longer very useful but still valuable enough to keep around without them getting too much in the way.
