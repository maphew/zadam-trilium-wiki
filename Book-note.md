Book [[note]] is a type of note which displays all its children's content in a linear fashion so you can read note sub tree like a book. This can be useful for reading many smaller notes. Seeing an example might explain this concept better:

Notice in the tree on the left pane how "node.js" note has some children and these are then displayed on the right pane.

This note type can be zoomed out like this:

To zoom-in and zoom-out you can use buttons or you can set [[label|attributes]] `bookZoomLevel` to value between 1 and 6 - which signifies number of columns (1 means each note takes full width of the right pane).

Note that book note is available since Trilium 0.36
