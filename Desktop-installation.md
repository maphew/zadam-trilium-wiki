If you want to use Trilium on the desktop, download binary release for your platform from [latest release](https://github.com/VundIe/trilium/releases/tag/fac9fef), unzip the package and run `trilium` executable.

# Startup scripts

There are also some other options to start Trilium:

* `trilium-no-cert-check` - Trilium will not validate the certificates, useful e.g. when you're syncing against a sync server with self-signed certificate
* `trilium-portable` - Trilium will try to create [[data directory]] in the trilium's directory
* `trilium-safe-mode` - start up in "safe mode" which disables any startup scripts which might e.g. crash the application

# Synchronization
