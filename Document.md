## Demo document

When you run Trilium for the first time, it will generate a demo document for you as a starting point. It's also pretty useful for demonstration of some of Trilium's features, e.g.:

* [[Relation map]]
* [[Day notes]]
* [[Weight tracker]]
* [[Task manager]]
* [[Custom CSS theme|Themes#custom-css-themes]] *Steel Blue*

### Restoring demo document

In some cases you might want to take a look at the demo document after you deleted it. Or you might want to see if there was something added (sometimes we add a new feature demonstration into demo document). In such case you can just [download .tar archive](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/blob/stable/db/demo.tar) of the latest document and import it somewhere into the tree (right click on a note where you want to import the demo document and choose "Import").
