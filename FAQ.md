# Mac OS support

Originally, desktop builds of Trilium Notes has been available for Windows & Linux, 
but there has been a considerable demand for Mac OS build. 

So I made one, but I underestimated the differences and specifics of Mac platform which seems 
to require special handling in several places. My lack of knowledge and frankly 
willingness to learn & code Mac specific functionality resulted in a current state 
where [Trilium does not integrate well into the OS](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/issues/511).

Mac OS build is from now on considered "unsupported". I will strive to keep it fundamentally functional, 
but I won't work on Mac specific features or integrations.
Note that this is more of an acknowledgment of an existing state rather than sudden change of direction.

Of course, PRs are welcome.
