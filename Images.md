Trilium supports adding images to notes. Supported formats are JPEG, PNG and GIF.

To add image to the note, simply drag it from file explorer onto the note editor inside Trilium and image will be uploaded.

Alternatively you can click on block toolbar and then on "Insert image":

Since Trilium isn't really meant to be primary storage for image data, it attempts to compress and resize (with pretty aggressive settings) uploaded images before storing them to the database. You may then notice some quality degradation.

If you want to save images in their original resolution, it is recommended to save them as attachment to note (top-right "Note actions -> Upload file").
