Link map is a visualization of links and relations incoming to and outgoing from a particular note.

This provides an insight into a structure ("web") of notes.

There's several types of links:

* hyperlinks - internal hyperlinks from one text note to another note
* relations - relation [[attributes]]
* image links - this link represents inclusion of an image in a text note
* relation map links - this link represents inclusion of a note in a [[relation map]]

[[Relation map]] is a similar concept, with some differences:

* link map is automatically generated while relation map must be created manually
* relation map is a type of note while a link map is just virtual visualization
