# Note navigation

Trilium has good support for fast navigation between notes.

## Backwards and forward

You can use alt-left and alt-right to move back and forward in history of viewed pages.

This works identically to browser backwards / forwards, it's actually using bult-in browser support for this.

Of course this is basic and expected functionality, but it's worth mentioning that Trilium plays nicely here.

## Recent notes

Recent notes allows you to view list of recently viewed / edited notes and quickly jump to it.

To access this functionality, you can click on ```Recent notes``` button on the top or press ```CTRL-E```. You can choose desired note and hit ```ENTER``` or click on ```Jump to``` button.

## Jump to note

This is useful to quickly find and view arbitrary note - click on ```Jump to``` button on the top or press ```CTRL-J```.
Then type part of the note name and autocomplete will help you pick the desired note. Then just press ```ENTER``` or click on ```Jump to``` button and you're there.
