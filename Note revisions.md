Trilium supports seamless versioning of notes by storing snapshots ("revisions") of notes at regular intervals.

Time interval of taking note snapshot is configurable in the Options dialog. This provides a tradeoff between more revisions and more data to store.

To turn off note versioning for particular note (or subtree), add `disableVersioning` [[label|Attributes]] to the note.

Note revisions can be accessed through note detail menu.
