Hoisting is a standard outliner feature which allows you to focus on (or "zoom into") a specific note and its subtree by hiding all parent and sibling notes. Demo:

[[gifs/note-hoisting.gif]]

In addition to showing only this subtree, this also narrows both full text search and [["jump to note"|Note navigation#Jump-to-note]] to just notes present in hoisted subtree.

Trilium supports this feature since version 0.26. Up to 0.45 note hoisting was global, from 0.46 it is per tab.
