This pages describes installing Trilium on your own server. You might want to do this in case you want to setup [[sync|Synchronization]] or you want to use it as online version of Trilium accessible from anywhere.

There are three options how to do this, each one with some advantage:

* Recommended: [[Packaged server installation]]
* [[Docker|Docker server installation]]
* [[Manual installation|Manual server installation]]

## Configuration

For server installations, you might want to configure e.g. port or [[TLS|TLS configuration]]. This is done in the Trilium config file, by default it's in ~/trilium-data/config.ini (where ~ is your home directory).
