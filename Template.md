Template is a form of [[attribute inheritance]]. 

Template is a note with a set of [[attributes]] and serves as a kind of "template" for other kind of notes (let's call them instance notes).

A typical example would be a "Book" template note which will define some [[promoted attributes]] - e.g. publication year, author etc.. And then we have instance note - this note has a [[relation|attributes]] to the "Book" template note which will cause that all attributes from the template note are inherited to the instance note.

You can check out the concept in the [[demo document|Document#demo-document]] in e.g. [[Relation map]], [[Task manager]] or [[Day notes]].
