Trilium Web Clipper is a web browser extension which allows user to clip text, screenshots, whole pages and short notes and save them directly to Trilium Notes.

Project is hosted [here](https://github.com/zadam/trilium-web-clipper). Firefox and Chrome are supported browsers, but the chrome build should work on other chromium based browsers as well.

Extension works with Trilium Notes 0.34 and newer.

# Get it

Extension is available from:

* [Mozilla addons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/54860da6dd0f4cddbde2) - recommended when using Firefox
* [Chrome web store](http://blabla) - recommended for Chrome users
* [Project release page](https://github.com/zadam/trilium-web-clipper/releases) - use when you use alternative chromium browser

# Configuration

The extension needs to connect to a running Trilium instance. By default it scans a port range on the local computer to find a desktop Trilium instance.

It's also possible to configure [[server|Server installation]] address for cases when the desktop application is not currently running.
